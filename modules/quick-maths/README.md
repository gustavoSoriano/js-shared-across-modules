# Quick Maths

This module imports the JS Util module. It makes use of the `jsCompile` gradle task to pull the targeted module into the `node_modules` of this module. You'll also need to see the `bnd.bnd` file for how to import the `js-utils` module. In the `.es.js` file you can see how to import and use the functions from the `js-utils` module.
